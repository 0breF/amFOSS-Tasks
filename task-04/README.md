Task-04 CineBot

I haven't created a telegram bot before so this was a bit of a drag, I had to go through the basics of how the bot is created and the functionalities provided by the resources which were given. 
This task did give me a bit of a trouble, because my dotenv module was not working for a while as well, a friend of mine helped me get through it and clear all the errors which I was facing (no it wasn't google :)
The gif of the working bot has been uploaded along with the source code, without the API keys
(I deleted the dotenv files after recording the gif)
