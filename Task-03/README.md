task-03 HackerRank

I tallied this, not gonna lie, as I was initially going to skip it (I have no clue why) . The questions are solvable provided I give enough time, but it's pretty evident from my submission time and score that I didn't have a good start for this task neither a good finish, nor was I able to give a certain amount of time for it.

The questions were fun and interesting as far as I've read. I would definetly try them out later.
