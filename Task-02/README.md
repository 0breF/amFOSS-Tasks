Task-03 Terminal Hunt

It was a fun task. I was familiar with basic git commands prior, so it didn't take me much time to complete this task. I learnt some new commands as well, which helped me complete the task. Surprisingly enough, except for the Chemistry question which involved the element Bohrium, I didn't require help from Google! Calculating the HCF is a pretty easy thing to do, but I also knew that the Goddess of War was Athens, particularly because I read a few parts of the Novel Percy Jackson in which one of the main characters, Annabeth Chase was the daughter of Athena.
