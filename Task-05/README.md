Task - 05 Find The Bug

The dotnet installation took some time and after the installation of dotnet 7.0 framework and correcting all the errors (according to my IDE), project wouldn't run. The error stated that dotnet 6.0 had to be downloaded, so I had to uninstall the already existing dotnet 7.0 and install dotnet 6.0. 
The code did run but it still had some minor errors which had to be cleared, it took me an embarassing amount of time to clear an easy error but after that it worked just fine. The file of rectified code and screenshot of the working model is attached.
I tried to record the gif file but for some reason its getting stuck and is very laggy, so decided to go with the screenshot itself.
