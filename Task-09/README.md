Task-09  9. Krypto Scrapper

I had no problems in the installation process as it was pretty straightforward. The references website provided holped me a lot in understanding the basic structure and functionality of rust and got me familiarized with crates and writing a program in rust. 
The challanging part about this task was to add the data into the csv file, but with the help my best friend (Google) I was able to learn enough about it to create and append the data into the csv file.
Before comitting my code and result, I had deleted the excess and garbage files which automatically get created after compilation and running so that it would be easier to focus on the code. The main code is located in the src file instide the web_scraper directory and the csv file is located in the web_scraper directory as well.
