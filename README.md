amFOSS Tasks STAGE-0

I am Abhinav Maddineni from Ongole, currently pursuing my S3 BTech in Computer Science Engineering at Amrita School of Engineering.


My views about the tasks:-

Some of the tasks were very beginner friendly, whilst the others were kind of tough to wrap our head around, personally I found the flutter and GoWasm tasks a bit overwhelming due to which I skipped them, I will try them later on at some poihnt but as of now those are the two main tasks I've chose to completely skip.
Well my git Commits suggest pretty much everything at this point XD, as you can see I had submitted almost half my tasks initially, then I let it get to my head a bit, and started slowing down. I was still doing them alongside other things, but I ran out of storage in my Ubuntu, and I accidentally erased all my Ubuntu as well as Windows data while trying to expand the storage (long story), so my entire progress was lost as I didn't commit them prior. Well after that it took me a few days to actually get my laptop to start working but was unable to retrieve the data which was lost. I almost gave up but wanted to give it one last shot, and so I reinstalled all the required softwares, revisited old tasks and concepts, redid the ones which were lost halfway, as a result only a fraction of my CS-50 task completed and i couldn't give my best in the Praveshan Hackerrank Competition as well, and now it's 5:21 AM, DEC 14 and the deadline is here, so am submitting my work.
Regardless of whether I would proceed further or not, I learnt some key values on time management, carelessness and lethargy which I would't be forgetting. It would be great if I actually did proceed for the further stages but if not, I did have mad fun and learnt a ton of new things, I would finish up the remaining tasks after the submission just for learning something new, thats how interesting the tasks were.
so thank you guys!

My Introduction:-

My name is Abhinav Maddineni and I'm from Ongole, Andhra Pradesh. I honestly am a beginner at coding, but curious to learn something new everytime I get an opportunity to do so, which is personally my favourite quality in me as well. I would like to get more exposure and correct guidance in competitive programming and on more domains like app development, web development, working on open source projects, hackathons etc, and I believe that joining amFOSS would act as a next step towards my goal and would satisfy my curiousity as well :)

1. Why must we choose you?

I am very eager to learn new things in the domain I'm interested in and I grasp on to them pretty quick as well. I'm sure there are a lot more competent people than me but I will take initiative and contribute to the club as much as I can, and am willing to put in time and effort for expanding my knowledge as well as a contributor to the club.

2. What is your plan for the next 6 months?

I want to get a good grasp on CPP and participate in Hackathons, as I'm interested in competitive programming and STL in CPP provides a whole new arsenal to the game. I also want to work on open source projects, particularly for GSoC. Although I'm a beginner, I believe that this club could help me achieve it through correct guidance and exposure.

3. How would you contribute back to the club?

I would contribute to the club back by working on open source projects, participating in Hackathons and more. Giving my best and gaining knowledge at every step is something I intend to do. I would give my time and effort towards the club activities.

4. Do you have any feedback on the selection process?

The selection process was very clear, it was beginner friendly and the tasks were very transperent as well. I could see what I had to do most of the times and at times I had no clue, my best friend (google) was of great help. Overall the selection process (except flutter and GoWasm) were really nice and not overwhelming in any sense, they just took a bit of time to complete. I personally enjoyed and had a mix of emotions at a certain point but that was completely on me and not on the tasks which were provided, and I believe there is a Stage 1 and Stage 2 for seniors who are interested in joining which looks promising as well considering (if i clear this stage) I would be able to work on the domains I'm exactly interested in and start working on projects.


EDIT:-
Forgot to delete the python additional files, so 99.7% of the entire repo is python (task-04) XD
