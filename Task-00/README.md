Task-00  Install Ubuntu 20.04

This task was a bit time taking, I knew that I had to dual boot, but at the time I was doing this task I was in class and I wasn't having a pendrive or a hard disk. So I started looking for alternatives to install the OS and ended up creating a partition. First I created a partition in my main memory, but some errors were popping up, so I decided to create the partition in my internal SSD as it had more space and I wanted to try using Ubuntu as my main OS as well. I disabled the secure boot in BIOS and was good to go.

Then I decided to customize my entire Ubuntu Display and Theme. So I scrolled through YouTube and finally found a customization which felt like my style. I customized my Display settings and entire Theme according that video. I didnt just follow it blindly though, I was understanding the uses of all the extensions downloaded and simultaneously scrolling through all of them in case i wanted to make a few changes in the future.
