Task-10 CS50

I am quite familiar with C as it was taught in my previous semester,so watching those lectures wouldn't be so impactful. I should've solved the psets but am in a bit of a time constraint so couldn't do them. I went throught them though, and will solve them in my free time, but at the time of submission I  haven't solved anything past Week-0.
