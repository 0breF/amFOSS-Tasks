Week-0 SCRATCH

The first lecture was all about basics. It included topics like Binary Language, Computers and Computer Science, Problem Solving, Algorithms, Photos and Videos, SCRATCH and it's basics etc. 
Personally, except for SCRATCH, I was familiar with every other aspect taught in the lecture, so it didn't have as much impact. It still was a fun watch though! The enthusiasm with which Professor David taught the course just kept me engaged throughout the entire lecture.

SCRATCH PROJECT:-

For my SCRATCH project I decided to make a multiplayer game, which I named Maze Runner. 

How to Play :-

1) W,A,S,D are the controls to move the Smilie.
2) Arrow Up, Arrow Down, Arrow left, Arrow Right are the controls to move the Cat.
3) If the Smilie finishes the maze, a wolfhound sound would be played and the Smilie would be set to the default position
4) If the Cat finishes the maze, a meow sound would be played and the Cat would be set to the default position
5) Press X to reset

The SCRATCH file for my project and the final screenshot of the game have been uploaded in this directory, all the conditions which were written in the Problem-Set 0 for making the SCRATCH project have been satisfied.
